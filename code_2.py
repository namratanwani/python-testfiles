                which can be modified after creation.
                		- `MutibleMapping`: An abbreviation for a mutable mapping, which
                can be modified after creation.
                		- `type`: A Python built-in function used to determine the type
                of an object.
                
                	In the function body, various checks and modifications are made
                on `obj` depending on its properties:
                
                		- If `part` is `None`, an exception is raised due to an invalid
                document type.
                		- If `part >= len(subobj)` or `part < 0`, an exception is raised
                because `part` is outside of the list.
                		- If `isinstance(subobj, MutableSequence) and part not in subobj`,
                an exception is raised because the object cannot be replaced outside
                of a list.
                		- If `isinstance(subobj, MutableMapping)` and `part` is not in
                the mapping, an exception is raised because the object cannot be
                replaced for a non-existent key.
                		- Otherwise, if `part is None`, an exception is raised due to
                an invalid json pointer.
                
                	In summary, `obj` is deserialized and analyzed for various
                properties and attributes before undergoing modification in
                accordance with the operation specified in the dictionary.

            can be a nested dictionary or list.
            		- `part`: The key part of the json pointer that led to this subtree.
            		- `value`: The value that was applied to the subtree at `part`.
            
            	The function checks if the given object can be successfully applied
            with the specified operation. If it is not possible, it raises a
            `InvalidJsonPatch` exception with a specific message related to the problem.
            
            	In the returned output, `subobj`, `part`, and `value` provide information
            about the part of the object that was modified or updated by the
            function. The `subobj` and `part` attributes give the details of the
